# ArduinoDcMotor

The purpose of this project is to implement a DC motor using an Arduino uno.

The DC motor is connected using two wires. A ground and a 5v power.
The DC motor is controlled by setting the motor speed from a range of 0-255.
The direction is set by declaring the direction signals in a combination of low and high.
A delay was utilized to allow the motor time to slow down before the next speed and direction commands.
